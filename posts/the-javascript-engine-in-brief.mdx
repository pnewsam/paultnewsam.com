description: Javascript is a high-level interpreted language. What does that mean in practice?
---

Javascript is a high-level, interpreted language. Before it can be run, it must be compiled to **bytecode** and then to **machine code**. (It differs therefore from lower-level languages like C or Go which are compiled directly to machine code.) This compilation is handled by the Javascript engine, and different execution environments use different Javascript engines. Chrome and NodeJS use V8, Safari uses JavascriptCore, and Firefox uses SpiderMonkey.

In addition to simply compiling the code, the engine performs memory allocation, garbage collection and performance optimization. This work is happening in real time whenever and wherever Javascript code is running, and that means that Javascript programs will always have a memory/CPU overhead that lower-level, compiled languages do not have. However the engine's performance optimizations mean that Javascript can still be very fast in practice.

Code execution happens in a few steps. First the Javascript code is converted into the **AST** or **Abstract Syntax Tree**. This syntax tree is then converted into **bytecode**, which is run by the **interpreter**. Then as the program runs, the engine monitors which code paths are run most frequently, and selectively compiles those **hot paths** to machine code. This is called a **tiered compilation** strategy, and it allows for a fast startup speed without compromising too much on performance.

Although these are simplified representations, this is what the code may look like at each of these steps:

**Javascript**

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
add(1, 2);
```

**Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**

```json
{
  "type": "Program",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "FunctionDeclaration",
      "id": {
        "type": "Identifier",
        "name": "add"
      },
      "params": [
        {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "name": "a"
        },
        {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "name": "b"
        }
      ],
      "body": {
        "type": "BlockStatement",
        "body": [
          {
            "type": "ReturnStatement",
            "argument": {
              "type": "BinaryExpression",
              "operator": "+",
              "left": {
                "type": "Identifier",
                "name": "a"
              },
              "right": {
                "type": "Identifier",
                "name": "b"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ExpressionStatement",
      "expression": {
        "type": "CallExpression",
        "callee": {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "name": "add"
        },
        "arguments": [
          {
            "type": "Literal",
            "value": 1
          },
          {
            "type": "Literal",
            "value": 2
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**V8 Bytecode (Simplified)**

```
// Function add
LdaZero                 // Load accumulator with 0
Star r0                 // Store accumulator to register 0
LdaSmi [1]             // Load Small Integer 1
Add r0                  // Add register 0 to accumulator
Return                  // Return with accumulator

// Calling code
LdaGlobal [0]          // Load 'add' function
Star r1                // Store in register 1
LdaSmi [1]             // Load argument 1
Star r2                // Store in register 2
LdaSmi [2]             // Load argument 2
Star r3                // Store in register 3
Call r1, r2, r3        // Call add(1,2)
```

**x86-64 Machine Code (Simplified)**

```nasm
; Function prologue
push    rbp
mov     rbp, rsp

; Load parameters
mov     rax, QWORD PTR [rbp+16]    ; Load first parameter
mov     rcx, QWORD PTR [rbp+24]    ; Load second parameter

; Add numbers
add     rax, rcx                   ; Add the numbers

; Function epilogue
pop     rbp
ret

; Calling code
mov     edi, 1                     ; First argument
mov     esi, 2                     ; Second argument
call    add                        ; Call the function
```
