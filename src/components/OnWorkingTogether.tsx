      On Working Together
    </h3>
    <p className="text-lg text-stone-500 mb-4">
      People aren&apos;t APIs. We&apos;re brilliant, and messy, and chock-full
      of contradictions. But given the challenges of working together, I think
      we can take some lessons from API design. We should be clear about what we
      need, how best to interact with us, and what we&apos;re able to provide.
      Here are a few things that describe my working style. If it sounds like we
      might work well together, let me know. ðŸ™‚

          <b className="text-blue-400">Mission-Oriented</b> - It&apos;s not
          always I&apos;m looking for a role where I can do focused, creative
          work.

          trust and credibility.
