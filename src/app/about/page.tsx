        I&apos;ve always been a curious person. Sometimes that&apos;s gotten me
        into trouble, but it&apos;s also led me to some interesting places.

        I&apos;ve worked as a field biologist, a barista, a software engineer, a
        ticket-taker, an Uber driver. I&apos;ve lived in San Francisco, San
        Diego, and Boston - and for a while when I was doing fieldwork, I lived
        out of a truck. I&apos;ve visited 23 countries and worked in 8 different
        states.

        These days, I spend my hours building frontends for web apps. I think
        that definining the relationship between humans and computers is only
        going to become more important, and I&apos;m grateful that I get to play
        a small part in that.
