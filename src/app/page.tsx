        Hey, I&apos;m Paul.
      </h2>

        I currently work as a frontend engineer at{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://iterable.com/">Iterable</ExternalLink>, a
        marketing automation platform. I&apos;ve been working in the tech
        industry for about 6 years now. Before that I worked on and off as a
        field biologist, doing bird and plant surveys for organizations
        like&nbsp;
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.usgs.gov/">USGS</ExternalLink>,{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.pointblue.org/">
          Point Blue
        </ExternalLink>
        , and{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.birdconservancy.org/">
          Bird Conservancy of the Rockies
        </ExternalLink>
        . I also had some odd jobs. I worked as a barista, a ticket-taker, and
        even drove Uber (for about a week).

        Outside of work, besides scheming about the products I&apos;d like to
        build, I love to run, hike, read, and train jiu jitsu. I&apos;ve lived
        in a few different cities, but as of 2020, I&apos;m back in my home town
        of San Diego, CA.

        I&apos;d love to hear from you.
