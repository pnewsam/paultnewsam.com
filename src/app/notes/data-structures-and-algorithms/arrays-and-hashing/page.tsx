        <Body>
          When it comes to data structures, arrays are about as fundamental as
          it gets. And whereas many data structures are <Mark>abstract</Mark> --
          meaning the underlying data structures can be implemented in many
          different ways across languages -- array implementations are pretty
          much the same across languages.
        </Body>

        <H2 className="mb-8">Sliding Window</H2>
        <Body>
          Sliding window is a technique used to solve problems involving
          subarrays.
        </Body>

        <H2 className="mb-8">Two-Pointer Technique</H2>
        <Body>
          The two-pointer technique is a common approach to solving problems
          involving arrays or linked lists.
